## Status

Production ready. 100% code coverage.

## Features

* Never leak goroutines: all functions will wait until the termination of all launched goroutines, whatever happen.

* Panics in goroutines are caught and propagated as errors.

* Task cancellation and timeout via [context.Context](https://pkg.go.dev/context#Context).

## API

* [`type Task = func() error`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/dolmen-go/rendezvous#Task)

* [`WaitAll(...Task) []error`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/dolmen-go/rendezvous#WaitAll)

* [`type TaskCtx = func(context.Context) error`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/dolmen-go/rendezvous#TaskCtx)

* [`WaitFirstError(...TaskCtx) error`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/dolmen-go/rendezvous#WaitFirstError)
